                    Hello! My name is Natalie Ramirez and my sister Erika and I created
                    this website for teen girls (like ourselves) who are bored but want 
                    to be productive and/or just do something that's not going to waste 
                    time and be boring. 
                
                <p>
                    With this website, you can get inspiration to do so many things and 
                    also ideas of what to do. Our mission is to get smart teen girls out 
                    of bed and stop watching so much Netflix and do something cool and 
                    interesting. Of course, I love Netflix too and love watching TV and movies,
                    but we have to do more than that, especially now that we are at home 
                    all day with nothing to do.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Anyway, summer is about to begin! So you know what that means... a lot of sitting
                    around and doing nothing. Yeah, quarantine sucks, but hopefully Erika and
                    I can provide you with lots of ideas for you to either get ahead in school,
                    make a cool new project, find your interests, give you good movie, show, or 
                    book recommendations, or advice for your social life and more! 
                </p>
