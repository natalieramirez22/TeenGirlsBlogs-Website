        <h2>Finding What You're Interested In</h2>
            <p>
                I know what it feels like to have no idea what it is that you want to do in the future. 
                To have friends and family always ask you "So what are you doing in college?" or "What are
                you interested in?" The truth is, you're not alone. If you're not sure yet what it is that 
                you want to do in college / the future, that's ok. I'm here to help a little bit.
            </p>
            <p>
                To begin, I recommending taking this <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/college-major-quiz" target="_blank">quiz</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, I believe it is much easier to get rid of majors / subjects that you are most definitely
                NOT interested in. Here is a list of majors that may or may not interest you. Once you click on 
                one, it will go more in depth until you find which one you seem most interested in. And remember, 
                it doesn't matter if you still can't narrow in on exactly one, if anything, it's great that 
                you are interested in many things! Just try to mentally cross off ones that you are sure you 
                do not want to pursue to narrow it down, but if there is a particular topic that calls out to you,
                then go further in depth!
            </p>

                                I had SO much fun. I highly recommend it, because the community is so supportive and full of
                                love and I was in the mobile app development section and learned a lot. I created an app with

        <h2>Scholarships for High Schoolers</h2>
            <p>
                If you are in high school, now is the time to apply for scholarships. College is super expensive, so any kind of 
                scholarship, whether it is big or small, helps. More local scholarships usually grant less money but are also much 
                less competitive than national scholarships. Since there are countless scholarships of all types for all different 
                types of students in different areas, I will put links to amazing websites with scholarships that could be perfect 
                for you. Some of these websites may ask you to create an account.

        <h2>Benefitial and Productive Things To Do</h2>
            <p>
                As a high school student, it is important to recognize that we have to do something big and impactful to really stand 
                out to college admissions people. Not only that, but also do it for yourself too. Doing an educational yet fun project 
                is a great opportunity to learn something new and explore new subjects in the area that you are interested in. There are 
                so many things to do right now, especially during quarantine, so I will give you a few ideas!

        <h2>What to Include in Your High School Resume</h2>
            <p>
                It's always a good idea to have a resume, no matter if you are a freshmen or a senior. You never know when a 
                good opportunity will come along and you're going to need your resume. You want to be prepared with a good and 
                up to date resume. Here I will provide some tips to how to have a good resume, what to include, and what people 
                are looking for when they read your resume. Remember, job recruiters usually read an average 
                of only 6 seconds per resume, since they have so many. So you want to make yours stand out. Here's how:
            </p>
            <p>First things first, you should <strong>emphasize your education</strong>. Make sure to include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Where you go to high school and when you graduate (i.e June 2022)</li>
                <li>What your GPA is (clarify if you put it unweighted or weighted)</li>
                <li>Your SAT/ACT scores (only include if they're impressive and/or you have already taken it)</li>
                <li>If you're on the Honor Roll (did you get first honors all of your sophomore year? Put that in there!)</li>
                <li>
                    List any relevant coursework you might be taking
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any other relevent academic achievements (Did you win a competition in the field the job is centered in? Did 
                    your school grant you an award?)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Then, put your work experience. Tell the job recruitors about any job, anything that you've ever gotten 
                paid for. Some examples include but are not limited to: lawn work, babysitting, tutoring, if you actually have a job, 
                that's great put that on there. This can also include community service hours, especially if you have a significant amount of hours, 
                that can be impressive. If you have neither, emphasize the extracurriculars you participate in, including 
                clubs, sports, and other organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third, highlight your leadership experience. <strong>Leadership is a key word</strong> in many resumes and having a lot of leadership experience 
                is important in resumes. This can include any community work that your doing, clubs that you're president of, teams that 
                you're captain of, and if you're involved in student council, that is a sign of leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other section includes any skills that you have. Here you include both <u>hard</u> and <u>soft</u> skills. Hard skills are abilities specific 
                to the job and based on experience and are learned, while soft skills are rooted in your personality and is not taught.
                <p>Some examples of hard skills are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Photoshop</li>
                    <li>Digital Design</li>
                    <li>Proficiency in Excel, Powerpoint, and Word</li>
                    <li>iMovie</li>
                    <li>Knowing a coding language</li>
                    <li>Being fluent in another speaking language</li>
                    <li>CPR Certified</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And examples of soft skills may include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Problem-Solving</li>
                    <li>Communication</li>
                    <li>Teamwork</li>
                    <li>Creativity</li>
                    <li>Work Ethic</li>
                    <li>Time Management</li>
                    <li>Adaptability</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Always start with and action verb, and <strong>quantify when possible</strong>. Numbers are what stand out in a resume full of words, so if you 
                have impressive numbers for anything, use them! These numbers can include how many people that you worked with or managed, how 
                much money that you raised, how many hours of community service or hours of work that you put into a project. Also, under each 
                item on your resume have no more than five bullet points or it will be too lengthy. Lastly, proofread your resume multiple times 
                before submitting it to an employer.

                Reading resume samples is a great way for you to get an idea of what a good resume looks like. Also using templates can help organize 
                the information on your resume and help it look much nicer. Your resume should not be longer than one page, so if there is a template where 
                you feel as though you cannot fit all that you want to say on it, use a different one. Use a template that adjusts for you, don't adjust to the 
                template.

                This is a resume that uses a template to make it look much cleaner and more appealing to the eye, which is exactly what you want. 
                While the first example is ok, it does not stand out and is heavy to read. Using a modern and sleek template is important. For beautiful

        <h2>Extra Tips and Tricks!</h2>
        <p>
            Now that we have gone over most important academic necessities, here are some random tips for beginning college! Personally I am not in college yet, so it 
            may seem weird that I am the one giving the tips, but trust me these are good.
        </p>

        <h3>While in High School Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You're going to want to start writing your college essays the summer before senior year because you are most likely going to be super busy during the 
                year and will not have enough time to write a great essay.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Make a list for college. This is in excel or spreadsheets and research colleges that you are interested in. You should have reach, high target, target, 
                low target, and safety schools on that list. Here is what you should write in the columns of your spreadsheet:
                    <ul>
                        <li>School Name</li>
                        <li>
                            List the platform you are going to use to apply (i.e. QuestBridge, Common App, Coalition, etc.) and if you're not
                            sure yet, don't include it! This can be added in later as well.
                        </li>
                        <li>Location - include city and state, or country</li>
                        <li>Financial aids! Some colleges don't provide out-of-state aids so make sure to do your research and find out if the ones you are interested in do</li>
                        <li>Acceptance rate - this should be a percentage</li>
                        <li>
                            Tuition - Include how much money you have to pay per year. This doesn't include books or anything else, but you can make a seperate column for that 
                            if you would like.
                        </li>
                        <li>Lastly, include the college's graduation rate</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                When writing an essay for college, make it specific to what you want, whether it is a program your interested in, research with a specific professor, anything so they
                know why you really want to go to their school.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                (For the essay) Do NOT write about a sports injury, volunteer opportunity, anything that is way overrused. Instead talk about any experience where 
                you learned from it and show growth and character.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                When writing your essay, start with putting the reader in the story, DON'T restate the prompt. As your telling your story, use a lot of details that show, don't tell
                the point that you're trying to make. Then at some point you're going to want to deviate from the story and start talking about the lessons you learned from it, or your 
                takeaway from the experience. Here you want to start talking about the traits of your thesis and how they define who you are and how it will continue to define you in 
                the future. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Make a document with everything that you've written for college. This can be used to reuse parts of old essays.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Apply to a bunch of local scholarships, even if they are not that much money, applying to many and winning them will add up!</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                This one is probably more well known, but if you are a high school student who is taking or will take AP courses, CollegeBoard has 
                videos for every single AP course. They are free online resources for students and I highly recommend watching them/taking notes to get 
                ahead in school.
